# User reviews
#### Came for the cast. Stayed for the characters.
I have never really been a big fan of interactive story games, but Dispatch had me counting the days til the next episodes dropped.
Great job, AdHoc. I sincerely hope you keep building upon this success and I'll be keeping my fingers crossed for a season 2.
  
  
#### "We joke, we laugh, we suppress our trauma."
I almost forgot what good writing in games sounds like. This is like a Telltale Invincible game we never got. The mix between 2D and 3D is a really interesting art style. It feels like an interactive movie and it needs to become a TV show.
  
  
#### A Telltale game, crossed with This is the Police, crossed with the superhero corniness of Invincible? 
You bet your ass I recommend this game.
