    <h2><b>League of Legends</b></h2>
    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
    <p><em>League of Legends</em> (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Riot Games, first released in 2009. In the game, two teams of five players each control unique characters called &quot;champions,&quot; with the objective of destroying the opposing team’s Nexus, which is the core building located within their base. The game is played on a map called Summoner’s Rift, which is divided into three lanes (Top, Mid, Bottom) and a jungle area between them. Players must work together, using their champions&#39; unique abilities, to fight enemy champions, complete objectives, and ultimately push toward the enemy base.  </p>
    <p>The game is known for its strategic depth and the variety of champions available, each with distinct playstyles, abilities, and roles. The roles are typically divided into: Top laner, Mid laner, Bot laner (often played in pairs with a Support), Jungler, and AD Carry (Attack Damage Carry). Each role has specific responsibilities—such as farming minions for gold, ganking (ambushing) enemies in the jungle, or protecting teammates in team fights. Success in League of Legends is not only based on individual skill but also on teamwork, map awareness, and timely decision-making.  </p>
    <p>A key aspect of LoL’s gameplay is its economy system. Players gain gold by killing minions, monsters, and enemy champions, which they can spend to purchase items that enhance their champion’s stats and abilities. Item builds can be highly situational, and understanding which items to buy in specific scenarios is a vital part of competitive play. In addition, champions level up throughout the game, unlocking new abilities and enhancing existing ones, which adds an extra layer of complexity to each match.  </p>
    <p>The game also features regular updates, which include new champions, balance changes, and seasonal events. These updates keep the game fresh and encourage players to adapt their strategies. Riot Games has created a robust esports ecosystem around LoL, with regional leagues and an annual World Championship, which is watched by millions of players and fans worldwide. The esports scene has grown significantly since the game&#39;s release, cementing League of Legends as one of the most prominent competitive gaming titles globally.  </p>
    <p>At its core, League of Legends has maintained its popularity due to its accessibility and the depth of its gameplay. It’s free-to-play, with a microtransaction model that offers cosmetic items such as skins and emotes but does not provide in-game advantages, ensuring a competitive balance. The game appeals to a wide range of players, from casual gamers to professional esports athletes, and continues to be a defining force in the world of online multiplayer games.  </p>
